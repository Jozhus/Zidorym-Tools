# Zidorym-Tools
Once upon a time a japanese anon posted their waifu ranking website, http://zidorym.sunnyday.jp/aaaaa/index.php, and let people vote.
I ended up finding multiple exploits to list out the entire database of waifus and automate voting. 
Another anon had the same idea as me and we competed in the rankings. We may have accidentally broken his site a few times.
Sorry about that.
Here are just a bunch of tools I had for it.
